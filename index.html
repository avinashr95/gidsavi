<p>Introduction</p>

<p>In this world people are becoming “patients” because of losing “patience”. Patience – a thing every person should practice. Patience (or forbearing) is the state of endurance under difficult circumstances, which can mean persevering in the face of delay or provocation without acting on negative annoyance or anger; or exhibiting forbearance when under strain, especially when faced with longer-term difficulties. Patience is the level of endurance one can have before negativity. It is also used to refer to the character trait of being steadfast. When a person loses his patience he ultimately loses his control and behaves like an animal. People when get anger they does not know what they are doing and what to do. Our concept explains and gives an idea to control our patience manually by using sensors which operates automatically.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>1.1 Problem Statement</p>

<p>Losing of patience causes serious disorder not only to our heath but it also affects us psychologically. It projects us as a person of no humanity to the world, as a result he is separated from his surroundings. The person who loses his patience ultimately loses his relationships.  He cannot survive as a normal human being. Loss of patience may also lead to hypertension. </p>

<p>1.2 Current Issues / Constraints </p>

<p>Due to lack of patience lot of people are becoming patients. We are losing every single thing in our life due to lack of patience. Due to lack of patience a family had been massacred recently in Uttarpradesh, kargil war between India Pakistan. People do not understand the value of life. Let us consider the following as an example. On 2 January 2016, a heavily armed group attacked the Pathankot Air Force Station, part of the Western Air Command of the Indian Air Force. Four attackers and two security forces personnel were killed in the initial battle, with an additional security member dying from injuries hours later. The gun battle and the subsequent combing operation lasted about 17 hours on 2 January, resulting in five attacks and three security personnel dead. All these things happens only due to lack of patience. If they would have thought a little and controlled their anger this would not have happened.</p>

<p>1.3 Future Process Flow due to this Solution</p>

<p>Patience plays an important role in our life everyday and hence we can control our anger and maintain patience by using sensors. Usually when people get anger they try to reducing the stress level and blood pressure level. This can also done by sensors. Though animals are more sensitive than humans, humans too have some sensitive parts in their body. A sensor can be placed in a sensitive muscle in our body which monitors our blood pressure rate. When we get anger, the pressure rate in our blood increases automatically. The sensor used here can detect it and send vibrating signals to our brain creating an awareness to us. This sensor can also stimulate the gland that will reduce the pressure rate in our blood which reduces our anger automatically. It also creates a refreshing feel in our body. This sensor can also be connected to our mobile device through which we can monitor our own blood pressure.</p>

<p>1.4 Additional Features</p>

<pre><code>         As much as the anger increases, the life span decreases. This sensor reduces the anger thereby increasing the life span. The sensor can be either placed in our body temporarily or permanently. 
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li> Solution Overview and Approach</li>
</ol>

<p>The sensor which is used here should be programmed earlier initializing the maximum limit for the blood pressure after which the device should stimulate the gland that reduces the pressure in our blood.
Then it should be placed in the sensitive part of our body.
Now the sensor starts working and when the blood pressure exceeds the maximum limit specified it starts stimulating the gland that reduces the blood pressure.</p>

<p>2.2. Technical Stack </p>

<pre><code>start


                                             Initialize the maximum
  and normal limit for  
the blood  pressure.


 Place the sensor in the 
 human body.





           B                           Read the blood pressure rate.






                                                              Is    No
                                         Blood pressure &gt; max pressure      B




Yes


                                           Stimulates the gland that 
A     reduces the blood pressure.





Is  No
Blood pressure=normal pressure     A
</code></pre>

<p>Yes</p>

<pre><code>                                                                 B
</code></pre>

<p>2.3. Non Functional Coverage
This sensor monitors the blood pressure in the human body and transmits the data to the user or to our relations. By monitoring the blood pressure rate and by transmitting the data we can take suitable precautions at needy time. This sensor by maintaining the blood pressure rate in our body helps us to lead a happy life.</p>

<p>3.Commercials</p>

<pre><code>The investment for this device varies depending upon the plan. The investment required for the permanent plan is more than the temporary plan. It also depends upon the features of the device.
</code></pre>

<p>If the device is without the transmitting medium the investment is low. Since the design is complex as it should be placed inside the human body the cost is high. But it can be made available to the users at economy rate in the future.</p>
